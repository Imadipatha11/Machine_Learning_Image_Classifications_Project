I will try to classify an image of my favourite 5 sports people in this machine learning project,
1) How to build end to end machine learning or data science project
2) Use Opencv library for face and eyes detection
3) data cleaning using opencv face detection and feature engineering using wavelet transforms
4) Model building using SVM, logistic regression, random  forest
5) Model fine tunning using gridsearchcv
6) Export model to a file and write python flask server around it that can server http requests generated by UI
